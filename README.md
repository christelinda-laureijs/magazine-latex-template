About the Project
================

This repository contains LaTeX code to create a beautifully typeset
magazine. The Magazine-preamble.tex file contains custom environments
for Question-and-Answer articles, author names, a preamble, and quotes.

## How to use

Step 1: Download, clone, or fork the project directory, and then open
the *magazine-latex-template.Rproj* file. This will open an R project
within R Studio. Ensure that you have a LaTeX distribution (for example,
the TinyTeX package will be fine).

Step 2: Read [Editor-instructions.pdf](Magazine/Editor-instructions.pdf)
found within the Magazine/ folder to see what commands and environments
are available.

Step 3: Within the same folder, read
[Example-article.pdf](Magazine/Example-article.pdf) to see what a
finished article will look like.

Step 4. Create a .Rmd file modelled after the Example-article.Rmd file.
Knit it to a PDF when you are done!
