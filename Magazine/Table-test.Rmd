\section{Table test}

\begin{preamble}
This is a demonstration showing how a full-width table can be inserted into the magazine. I would recommend not using the table within a multicols environment.
\end{preamble}

\lettrine{I}{nstructions} Using colors or any method of your choice, match the hormones, their respective function and the gland that secretes it in one color. Repeat until everything is colored. Each gland and each function can only be associated to one hormone.
