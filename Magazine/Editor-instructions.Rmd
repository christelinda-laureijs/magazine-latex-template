# Editor Instructions

This document will help you get up and running with magazine creation. If you're thinking, "What is \LaTeX\?", I have a short intro section at the end of this document!

### Overview

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Write your article
  \item Decide if your article needs any subsection headers to break up the text
  \item Identify if your article has any of the following:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A disclaimer/preamble before the main content
    \item Subsection headers
    \item A Q\&A
    \item An author name
    \item References
    \item Any background images
    \item Any special characters, superscripts, or subscripts
  \end{itemize}
  \item Read through the instructions below to identify the environment tags you'll need.
  \item Add the tags to your document. For example, you may need to surround the author name with begin\{author-name\} and end\{author-name\}.
  \item If using background images, create an 8.5" x 11" image (.PNG at at least 300 DPI or a .PDF)
  \item Copy the Blank-article.Rmd and insert your content
  \item Knit the article to a PDF and tweak the output until you're satisfied
\end{enumerate}

### Preamble

Some articles require some explanatory text or a disclaimer before the main content. Use the preamble environment for this.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{preamble}

Insert disclaimer text here, an intro, etc...

\end{preamble}
\end{verbatim}

### Section headers

Use the \\section{} argument for article titles

\begin{verbatim}
\section{Article title}
\end{verbatim}

If you have a dark background image, you may want to change the text color. Use the following code for the title:

\begin{verbatim}
\section{\color{white} Alice in Wonderland}
\end{verbatim}

For subsections, use \\subsection{} (equivalent to Heading 2 in Word) and \\subsubsection{} (i.e. Heading 3)

\begin{multicols}{3}

\subsection{Heading 2}

\begin{redacted-text}
Lorem ipsum odor amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Tristique ridiculus interdum faucibus tellus maecenas accumsan mauris vulputate. Aliquam sollicitudin eros phasellus gravida cursus tortor lacus pulvinar.

Penatibus dictum magnis sollicitudin dictumst malesuada fermentum porttitor. Proin eu sem eget aliquet; semper suspendisse potenti ridiculus et. Aptent parturient aptent rhoncus malesuada condimentum.

\end{redacted-text}

\subsubsection{Heading 3}

\begin{redacted-text}
Nisi mus nostra congue varius pretium magnis; non dictum elit. Bibendum venenatis ac at magna mauris. Torquent taciti arcu ligula vehicula mus non dignissim fermentum. Sagittis mollis orci aenean molestie curae lacinia nostra ullamcorper.

Suscipit odio duis gravida habitant volutpat arcu. Auctor diam maximus in egestas curae rhoncus. Efficitur lectus gravida dolor ut cursus vehicula quam parturient! Luctus eleifend lacinia; velit placerat metus arcu orci vulputate.

\end{redacted-text}

\end{multicols}

### Q\&A

Type \\Q and then the question. Type \\A before the answer. Questions and answers will then have specialized drop-caps to make them stand out nicely.

\begin{verbatim}
\Q What happened to Alice?
\A She saw a stressed rabbit.
\end{verbatim}

### Background images

This template uses full-bleed background images. They must be 8.5 in x 11 in, and they can be either .PDF or .PNG files (if .PNG, try to have at least 300 DPI).

I've created a new command called \\InsertBackgroundPicture{}, which uses \\AddToShipoutPictureBG* from the *eso-pic* package. This allows you to place a full-size background picture to a specific page. The command accepts one argument, which is the filepath for the image. I'm using two dots at the beginning of the name (\textit{../}) to specify that LaTeX needs to move up one folder level (relative to this \textit{.Rmd} file) and then into the \textit{Images/} folder.

\begin{verbatim}
\InsertBackgroundPicture{../Images/Alice-article-background-A.png}
\end{verbatim}

### Superscripts/subscripts

Use the caret (^) symbol on both sides of the character that will become the superscript. Use the tilde (~) symbol on both sides of the character that will become the subscript.

\begin{verbatim}
H~2~O

R^2^
\end{verbatim}

### Author names

To insert an author name, type in the following code near the end of the article.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{author-name}
Lewis Carroll
\end{author-name}
\end{verbatim}

The line will automatically stretch to fill the current text container. In the following example, I placed the author environment before \\end{multicols} to have it only take up one column.

\begin{redacted-text}

\begin{multicols}{3}

Lorem ipsum odor amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Tristique ridiculus interdum faucibus tellus maecenas accumsan mauris vulputate. Aliquam sollicitudin eros phasellus gravida cursus tortor lacus pulvinar.

Penatibus dictum magnis sollicitudin dictumst malesuada fermentum porttitor. Proin eu sem eget aliquet; semper suspendisse potenti ridiculus et. Aptent parturient aptent rhoncus malesuada condimentum.

Nisi mus nostra congue varius pretium magnis; non dictum elit. Bibendum venenatis ac at magna mauris. Torquent taciti arcu ligula vehicula mus non dignissim fermentum.

\begin{author-name}

Lewis Carroll

\end{author-name}

\end{multicols}

\end{redacted-text}

### References

Use the references environment tag.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{references}
Paste in references here...
\end{references}
\end{verbatim}


## What is \LaTeX?

\LaTeX\ (pronounced lay-tech) is a free program used to create beautifully typeset documents like books, theses, and newsletters. It is very different than Microsoft Word. Instead of selecting text and clicking on a button to make it \textbf{bold} or \textit{italicized}, you write code like \\textit{} for italics. It seems like more work than necessary, but there are several strong advantages for using \LaTeX.

### Beautiful typography

\LaTeX\ automatically handles a lot of typesetting details including:

\begin{itemize}

\item Kerning - aesthetically pleasing spacing between letters based on their shapes
\item Ligatures - new characters for letter combinations like fi and ff, which often crash into each other in Word documents (see Figure \ref{ligatures} for a comparison).
\item Text justification without creating white rivers of blank spots
\item Consistent styles for section headers, citations, figure captions and numbering, etc.
\item and more!

\end{itemize}

Really, only typography nerds will notice or care about these details. But professional-quality typesetting does have an overall effect on the appearance of the document.

```{r ligatures-comparison}
#| fig.cap = "Ligatures are specialized characters that replace letter combinations like \\textit{fi}. Left: Word does not automatically include ligatures, so these letters clash. In this Word example, notice the collision between the curve of the \\textit{f} and the dot in \\textit{i}. The word \\textit{office} also has slightly misaligned \\textit{f}'s. Right: \\LaTeX{} has full support for ligatures. These words showcase the \\textit{ffi} and \\textit{fi} ligatures. \\label{ligatures}",
#| fig.scap = "Ligature comparison.",
#| out.width = "70%",
#| purl = FALSE

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Images/Ligature-comparison.png"))
```


```{r drop-caps-comparison}
#| fig.cap = "This figure highlights some key differences between typesetting in Word (left) and \\LaTeX{} (right). Notice how Word creates a misaligned drop-cap and awkward justification, with several gaps (highlighted in red). \\LaTeX{} produces neatly aligned text, and it even uses small caps to emphasize the first word. \\label{drop-caps}",
#| fig.scap = "Ligature comparison.",
#| out.width = "70%",
#| purl = FALSE

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Images/Dropcaps-comparison.png"))
```


### No manual formatting

You don't need to manually adjust spacing, figure numbers, or page numbers.

### Uses Plaintext

Word documents often crash when they get too large or have too many images. Since \LaTeX\ uses plaintext files (.txt) and sources images externally, your document stays small and portable. Plaintext files can open on any operating system, and they aren't locked into a specific version or program. You can open decades-old .txt files and they still work. You can easily link your writing to version control software like Git.

### Handles large, complex documents well

\LaTeX makes it easy for you to manage large documents like a thesis or book because it allows for easy cross-referencing of figures, footnotes, quotes, and citations. To add a list of figures, just type \\listoffigures!

Inserting a new page or image into a lengthy document (typically a harrowing process in Word) is not  difficult in \LaTeX\ and you have a lot of control over the layout of your sections. It's easy to move things around, and \LaTeX\ will automatically re-number all your figures and footnotes.

### Mathematics

One of the best features of \LaTeX\ is its mathematical typesetting. This includes auto-aligned equations and the ability to add specialized mathematical notation.

\[
\int_a^bu\frac{d^2v}{dx^2}\,dx
=\left.u\frac{dv}{dx}\right|_a^b
-\int_a^b\frac{du}{dx}\frac{dv}{dx}\,dx.
\]
