This repository contains LaTeX code to create a beautifully typeset magazine. The Magazine-preamble.tex file contains custom environments for Question-and-Answer articles, author names, a preamble, and quotes.

## How to use

Step 1: Click on the "Code" button and download a zip folder containing this repository. If you have a GitHub account you could also click on the "Use This Template" button to make your own repository and then clone it to your computer. Open the `magazine-latex-template.Rproj` file. This will open an R project within R Studio. Ensure that you have a LaTeX distribution (for example, the TinyTeX package will be fine).

Step 2: Read [Editor-instructions.pdf](Magazine/Editor-instructions.pdf) found within the Magazine/ folder to see what commands and environments are available.

**BIOL 4211 Students**: Please read [BIOL-4211-Editor-instructions.pdf](Magazine/Editor-instructions.pdf). See the folder `Sample-article-submission` to see examples of what your word document and images should look like.

Step 3: Within the same folder, read [Example-article.pdf](Magazine/Example-article.pdf) to see what a finished article will look like.

Step 4. Create a .Rmd file modeled after the `Example-article.Rmd` file. Knit it to a PDF when you are done!


```{r cover-image, fig.align = 'center', fig.alt = "Screenshot of a magazine article produced using this template. The template features full-bleed background images, drop caps, quotes, and a drop-cap question and answer style.", echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Images/Alice-magazine-screenshot.png"))
```
