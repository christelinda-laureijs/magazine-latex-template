# Instructions

This repository contains LaTeX code to create a beautifully typeset magazine. The Magazine-preamble.tex file contains custom environments for Question-and-Answer articles, author names, a preamble, and quotes.

## How to use

Step 1: Download, clone, or fork the project directory, and then open the *magazine-latex-template.Rproj* file. This will open an R project within R Studio. Ensure that you have a LaTeX distribution (for example, the TinyTeX package will be fine).

Step 2: Read [Editor-instructions.pdf](Magazine/Editor-instructions.pdf) found within the Magazine/ folder to see what commands and environments are available.

Step 3: Within the same folder, read [Example-article.pdf](Magazine/Example-article.pdf) to see what a finished article will look like.

Step 4. Create a .Rmd file modelled after the Example-article.Rmd file. Knit it to a PDF when you are done!

```{r cover-image, fig.align = 'center', fig.alt = "Screenshot of a magazine article produced using this template. The template features full-bleed background images, drop caps, quotes, and a drop-cap question and answer style.", echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Images/Alice-magazine-screenshot.png"))
```
